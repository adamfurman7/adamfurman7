### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Adam

I'm a career-changer, leaving my role as a product marketing manager in fintech behind to pursue a career in technology. I'm interested in computer science, programming, internet privacy & security, and free & open source software. Currently, I'm studying cybersecurity and information assurance at WGU while self-learning computer science and programming on the side.
